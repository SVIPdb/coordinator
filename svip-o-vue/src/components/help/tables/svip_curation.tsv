Evidence type	Evidence type based on the potential clinical actionability of the variant in a given disease.	Prognostic	Evidence type based on the potential clinical actionability of the variant in given disease. Three types of clinical significance evidences are available according to guidelines. Predictive (therapeutic): variant that indicates sensitivity or resistance to a specific therapy. Prognostic: variant that predicts the course of a disease.Diagnostic: variant that supports the diagnosis of a disease.  Also See Pathogenicity for more details.	
Effect	List still to be worked out	Poor outcome	Consequence of the variant observed during a clinical or functional investigation.
