SVIP information field	Short description	Example	Complete description	Reference
Disease	Disease name according to the ICD-O ontology	?	International Classification of Dsease for Oncology (ICD-O3)	https://codes.iarc.fr/
# of patients	Number of samples in SVIP for the given disease.	11/30	Number of samples in SVIP for the given disease, expressed as (number of samples with this variant in this disease / total number of samples with this variant). This proportion describes the frequency of a variant within a specific disease on the basis of the SVIP data.	
Age distribution	Age distribution of carriers of the variant in a given disease in SVIP (absolute number and percentage)		Age distribution ( absolute number and percentage) of carriers in SVIP, by category of age (under 40, 40 to 60, 60 to 80, and above 80 years old) for the variant in a given disease.	
Gender balance	Male and female carriers of the variant in a given disease in SVIP (absolute number and percentage)		Gender balance of the carriers of the variant in a given disease in the SVIP samples data.	
Pathogenicity	Potential ability of the variant to cause or to worsen a certain disease.	Pathogenic	Potential ability of the variant to cause or to worsen a certain disease. X levels of “pathogenicity” are available. Waiting for discussionPathogenic?Likely pathogenic?Unknown?Benign?	
Clinical significance	Potential clinical actionability of the variant in a given disease.	Predictive	Potential clinical actionability of the variant in given disease. Three types of clinical significance evidences are available according to guidelines. Predictive (therapeutic): variant that indicates sensitivity or resistance to a specific therapy. Prognostic: variant that predicts the course of a disease.Diagnostic: variant that supports the diagnosis of a disease.	Where do we have that from? AMP/ASCO/CAPS guidelines (with our own definitions)
Status	Status of the variant in the SVIP database.	Curated	Status of the variant in the SVIP database. Five statuses are available. Loaded: variant present in SVIP but not annotated Under curation: variant currently under manual curation Curated: variant with manually curated evidences of pathogenicity and/or clinical significance Under review: curated variant submitted to the expert panel for review Reviewed: curated variant that went through an expert panel decision	
SVIP confidence	Not definitive:Level of confidence of the variant interpretation after curation and review process.
