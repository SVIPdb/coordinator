# pmca viewer: extra modules

The 'elix' module in this folder is apparently an older version of the elix library (https://github.com/elix/elix),
but I haven't been able to identify the version that's used on https://candy.hesge.ch/pmca/index.html. Until we track
down which version it is so that we can depend on it properly, I've copied the 'elix' code from candy.hesge.ch to this
folder and included it in 'pmca-viewer.js'.
